Shumway is an HTML5 technology experiment led by [Mozilla Research](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/research/) that explores building a faithful and efficient renderer for the SWF file format without native code assistance.
Shumway is a drop-in replacement for the Flash player and can be used as an extension in Firefox, or embeded in any page that needs to run Flash content.

### Try it out!

Install the latest Shumway [extension](./extension/firefox/shumway.xpi) and read more about [configuring the extension](https://github.com/mozilla/shumway/wiki/Debugging-and-Configuring-Shumway#using-the-extension").

## Want to get involved?

For more information about development, [see the developer wiki](http://github.com/mozilla/shumway/wiki), or find us on the #shumway IRC channel (irc.mozilla.org).

You can also clone the project with [git](http://git-scm.com"):

```
git clone git://github.com/mozilla/shumway
```

### Demos

Once you have installed the Shumway extension, all `.SWF` files loaded by Firefox will be executed by Shumway instead of the Flash player.
Below are some neat demos:

[Mode](http://www.flixel.org/mode/) is a shooter demo game written using the [Flixel](http://www.flixel.org/) game engine.
(Pro Tip: press `~` to enter Debug Mode once you are in the game.)

[Canabalt](http://www.adamatomic.com/canabalt/) is a popular side-scroller endless running game also based on Flixel.
